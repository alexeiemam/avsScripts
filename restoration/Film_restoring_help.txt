Film restoring script help file by videoFred.
=============================================


1) How to use Avisynth scripts.
--------------------------------

You must learn some Avisynth basics first before using my script.
www.avisynth.org


A very easy way to use Avisynth scripts is by using VirtualDubMod.
VirtualDubMod has a build-in Avisynth script editor.
Download: http://virtualdubmod.sourceforge.net/

When an Avisynth script is loaded in VDMod you will see the result of the script, as a video file.
To see the script in the editor, push ctrl+E. The script pops up in a new window.
You can modify it and when still in the editor window, push f7.
The modified script is saved and reloaded in VDMod.
So you see the changes at once without leaving VDMod.

====================================================================================================


2) Where to place all the files and plugins.
--------------------------------------------

Make a separate folder and place the script and all needed DLL and AVS files in it.
This way, there is no need to use the Avisynth Plugins folder.

My script is using both plugins and functions.
Plugins are DLL files, functions are written in AVS files.
This can be confusing, because functions are asking for specific plugins also.
To see what is all needed to run my script, please look at the #PLUGINS section.


3) Film restoring script - general.
-----------------------------------

I have made this script to improve my transfered 8mm film files.
My transfer system can be found here: www.super-8.be
An example clip of what the script can do: http://www.vimeo.com/2823934
All my clips: http://www.vimeo.com/user678523/videos/sort:newest

The script needs a good quality digital film transfer file to begin with. 
The file must be frame accurate: one film frame = one AVI frame.

The script will not work good if the original file contains duplicate frames.
It will also not work good if the original file is interlaced.
You will have to remove interlacing and/or duplicate frames before using my script.

My script is not made to work with old low resolution film-to-video transfers.
To improve VHS and other formats, there are other solutions available.
But if the original film is still available, please concider a new transfer.

===================================================================================================


4) Film restoring script - parameters.
--------------------------------------

All parameters are placed in variables, they are all placed together on top of the script.
Do not change the names from the parameters! Only change the values.
These values are always numbers, except for 'result' and 'film'.

FILM:
Here you must place the source clip. The full path is required.
The source can be anywhere on your computer, even on an external harddrive.


# GENERAL PARAMETERS.
=====================


RESULT
-------

I have placed this variable at the top of the script.
So you can change this very fast to see the different results and/or comparisons.

All outputs are stabilized, denoised, resized, cropped and sharpened depending on the parameters.
Gamma correction, saturation, play speed and frame rate convertion is also applied on all outputs.

Some parameters will only have effect when returning the proper "result"
For example color settings "blue" and "red" will have no effect when returning "result1".

 result= "result1": both autolevels and autowhite 
 result= "result2": manual levels, autowhite
 result= "result3": autolevels, manual color correction
 result= "result4": manual levels, manual color correction
 result= "result5": service clip, no need to use it
 result= "result6": a mix from result3 and the original for those who want some grain.
 result= "result7": special clip original vs stabilized clip to check the stabilizer.

result= "resultS1": comparisons: original vs modified clips: options S1,S2,S3,S4 and S6



TRIM_BEGIN,  TRIM_END
---------------------
Add here the number of frames you want to remove from the beginning and the end of the clip.
If you do not want to trim frames, add 0 here.

PLAY_SPEED
----------
Your input file can have any play speed, this parameter will change it.

NUMERATOR, DENUMERATOR
----------------------
Please do not confuse this with play_speed.
This is the final frame rate for the output.
It will create intermediate interpolated frames.
Sometimes it is great for panning scenes etc.
Sometimes it fails on very fast moving objects.
To disable the interpolation, set NUMERATOR to the same value as PLAY_SPEED and set DENUMERATOR to 1

A few examples:
---------------

Assumed we have a one film frame = one AVI frame file:

Super-8 to standard PAL with interpolation: play_speed= 18, numerator= 25, denumerator= 1
the play speed will be 18fps, the output will be 25fps progessive
A standard Mpeg2 encoder will add no duplicates but will interlace it.

Super-8 to standard PAL without interpolation: play-speed=18, numerator=18, denumerator= 1
the play speed will be 18fps, the output will be 18fps progressive
A standard Mpeg2 encoder will add duplicates and interlacing.

Super-8 to standard NTSC with interpolation: play_speed= 18, numerator= 30000 denumerator= 1001 
the play speed will be 18fps, the output will be 30000/1001= 29,97fps progressive

Creating smooth slow motion standard PAl output: play-speed= 6, numerator= 25, denumerator= 1

To disable the interpolation completely:
----------------------------------------
delete the code line "interpolated= denoised2.MFlowFps etc....."
and change this: "sharp3= unsharpmask(denoised2,USM etc..."

With interpolation disabled frame rate convertion can be done in Avisynth with "changeFPS()"
But any NLE will do this in the time line too.
